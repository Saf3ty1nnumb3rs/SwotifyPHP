### Challenges

#### I have never coded in PHP before. Having coded in several other languages, it was a quick pick up. Repition will drive the syntax and core functionalities home and make me more comfortable with executing in PHP.

#### I was a little rusty on jQuery but I pulled it off with style and grace.

#### This was my first time using MySQL, but having used PostgreSQL in the past, it was a breeze. MySQL is very user friendly.
